### 🧠 Combinational Circuits
- Half/Full adders (structural, dataflow, behavioral)
- Carry Lookahead, Ripple Carry, 4-bit, 8-bit adders
- MUX/DEMUX, encoders/decoders, comparators
- Operators (bitwise, logical, reduction, etc.)

### 🕹️ Sequential Circuits
- D Flip-Flops, Latches, S-R Flip-Flops
- Counters (up/down/load/modulo)
- Clock dividers and pulse generators
- FSMs (Moore/Mealy, overlap & non-overlap)
