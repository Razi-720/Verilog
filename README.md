## What You’ll Find

### ALU & Memory Modules
- 8-bit and generic ALUs
- Synchronous RAM
- Register file with testbenches

### Combinational Circuits
- Half/Full adders (structural, dataflow, behavioral)
- Carry Lookahead, Ripple Carry, 4-bit, 8-bit adders
- MUX/DEMUX, encoders/decoders, comparators
- Operators (bitwise, logical, reduction, etc.)

### Sequential Circuits
- D Flip-Flops, Latches, S-R Flip-Flops
- Counters (up/down/load/modulo)
- Clock dividers and pulse generators
- FSMs (Moore/Mealy, overlap & non-overlap)
- Shift Registers (SISO, SIPO, PIPO, PISO)

### Function Practice
- Examples using `function`, `task`, and modular logic

### Miscellaneous
- LFSRs, FIFO, pseudo-random generators
- ROM/RAM examples (sync/async, single/dual port)
- Basic encryption modules
